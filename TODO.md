# TODO
This is probably more for me to keep track of things, but if anyone else wants to do stuff (as shown in readme), feel free...
- Make all PHP require, require_once, and include relative to $_SERVER\[\'DOCUMENT_ROOT\'\]."php/file.php";
- Organize /other, ideally it shouldn't exist.

# Games
- All games accessible in /game/v2
- More board games, maybe like Go or something
- Once games are in standardized format, add an "Invite AI" button to games where the AI would try its best to beat the player (start with Tic Tac Toe, then connect-4, etc)
- Make TicTacToe look good
