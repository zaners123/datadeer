# CSS
Cascading Style Sheets are commonly used to make websites look good.

Feel free to improve mine so that someday, the website does that.

Files:
- css.css: The primary file, used on nearly every page

All the other files are pretty explanatory by name, used either for holidays (christmas.css), for settings (dark.css,mouse.css,pink.css,sickness.css), or for subscribers (sub.css).
