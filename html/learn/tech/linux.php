<h1>Should I get Linux?</h1>
<hr>
<div class="textful">
	Linux is a <b>FREE</b> family of open source operating systems. It is used by most servers and by most hackers. But why would you want it?
	<br>
	Linux is:
	<ul>
		<li>Open Source</li>
		<li>More secure</li>
		<li>More Private</li>
		<li>Faster</li>
		<li>Safer</li>
		<li>Incredibly easy to configure</li>
	</ul>
	Linux is very easy to configure and open source. Because of this, if you don't like something about it (how it looks, the shortcuts, etc) there are probably 5 alternatives, or you could make your own!<br>
	For personal use, it's great for for:
	<ul>
		<li>Someone who likes free stuff</li>
		<li>Programmers</li>
		<li>Computer Nerds</li>
		<li>Someone who wants privacy</li>
		<li>Someone who doesn't like being constantly monitored by Windows or Apple</li>
	</ul>
	If your in one of these groups, I would strongly recommend Linux.
	If you want to try it out (without installing it), I'd recommend <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">trying Ubuntu here</a>.<br><br>
