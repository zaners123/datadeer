<h1>Building your first PC, the DOs and DON'Ts</h1>
<div class="textful">
	The first thing to know is it is not as hard as it sounds.
	It is completely modular, so it's basically plug and play, but here is what I did, and what I would recommend.<br><br>

	I would recommend deciding your parts in this order, so it is easier to tell what you will need:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Motherboard</b> - This is first because it is what every other part is based off of. If you want a small PC, go with mATX. If you want a gaming beast, go with ATX. Make sure it has PCIe x16. Also, <b>it should be expandable</b>. This is because if you buy a motherboard that perfectly fits the rest of your system (Ex: max of 16GB of memory and you buy 16GB of memory), you could not expand it at all. I would recommend an overkill motherboard so you can be more modular when upgrading. To be exact, I would recommend a motherboard expandable to 4x the ram you initially put in it, one CPU level higher (i3 to i5, i5 to i7, or i7 to i9), and a couple extra SATA ports. You're going to base all other parts off of this, so pick one with the right specs.</li>
		<li><b>CPU</b> - Don't just assume having an I7 or I9 means your computer is good. Scale it to the rest of your PC or it will be the bottleneck. Also, I would recommend a high end I5 because it will cost half as much as an I7 but have the same specs.
		<li><b>CPU Cooler</b> - Stock coolers (the one that comes with the CPU) are <i>usually</i> fine. If you plan on overclocking (<a href="overclocking.php">which I don't recommend</a>), then you would need a better cooler.
		<li><b>Ram</b> - Don't short yourself it, its nice to have. If you have above 16GB, you're good. Also, <b>make sure you get the right type</b>! See if it is compatible with your motherboard.
		<li><b>GPU</b> - Great for gaming, important for VR. For 90% of gamers (as of 2018), a NVidia 1050TI is great. It has 4GB of ram and runs smooth. If you have a VR headset or love huge games, try for a fancier one.</li>
		<li><b>Storage</b> - Storage is incredibly cheap, so you might as well get a ton. I'd get a small SSD for your OS and a large HDD for backups or pictures. Make sure your motherboard has enough SATA ports.</li>
		<li><b>Power Supply</b> - This is the one part of the PC you can not mess up on. First, look up the wattage of everything you put in the PC (CPU+GPU+memory+motherboard+etc). Then add around 20-30% to your total. This is the minimum watt power supply you want. Then find a power supply with all the outputs you need (SATA power, motherboard, graphics card power, CPU power, etc). Make sure you buy a power supply with at least 75% efficiency, or else it will waste an insane amount of power. Also, <b>do not buy the cheapest one you see</b>. If you do it will catch everything on fire or destroy your whole PC. Consider getting a modular one. You can remove the output cables you don't need so you don't have a ball of cables next to your power supply.</li>
		<li><b>Case Fans</b> - These are vital and cheap. Get ones with a huge CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) because your computer will stay nearly room temperature.
		<li><b>Case</b> - This is last on the list because it has to fit everything else inside of it. I would recommend one a size larger than your motherboard, because it's nice to have the space. Also, get one with space behind the motherboard.</li>
	</ol><br>
	Here's some general computer building knowledge:
	<ul>
		<li>Zip-Tying fans into the case is actually pretty awesome.</li>
		<li>Have your fans pointing from the front of your case to the back.</li>
		<li>Learn what positive case pressure is and set your fans up to have it.</li>
	</ul>
	After buying your parts, plug 'em all together (I'd recommend using an antistatic wristband for the CPU, memory, and GPU). Make sure to have good cable management.
