<h1>How to play chess</h1>
<div class="textful">
	Chess is a two-player turn-oriented game where the goal is to capture the other team's king.<br>
	The board starts with a simple setup, then white goes first (click the piece, then click where you want it to go to)

	<h2>NOTES:<br>
	&emsp;You CAN move into check, so be on edge!<br>
	&emsp;You won't be told if you're in check, and don't have to move.<br>
	&emsp;There's no "pawn promotion" or "En passant", so be wary.<br>
	&emsp;There's no timer, so take as long as you want.<br>
	</h2>



	<h1>Pieces</h1><br>

	♙ Pawn Moves forward one or two spaces in its first move; moves one space forward at a time thereafter. Captures pieces 1 square forward diagonally<br><br>
	♘ Knight Moves and captures in an L shape: two spaces in any direction and one space out at a 90 degree angle. Can jump over other pieces<br><br>
	♗ Bishop Moves and captures diagonally as far as it would like in an unobstructed single direction<br><br>
	♖ Rook Moves and captures along non-diagonal straight lines as far as it would like in an unobstructed single direction<br><br>
	♕ Queen Moves and captures along any straight lines (diagonal or non-diagonal) as far as it would like in an unobstructed single direction. A combination of a bishop and a rook<br><br>
	♔ King Moves and captures one space in any direction, <b>EVEN IF</b> it won't be in "check" in the new square<br><br>

	<h1>Gameplay</h1><br>

	Basic play The player using the white pieces goes first; players then alternate turns until the end of the game<br><br>
	Checkmate If a player's king is under immediate attack (in check) by an enemy's piece and the player cannot get their king out of check (by moving the king, capturing the attacking piece, or blocking the attack), they are checkmated and have lost<br><br>
