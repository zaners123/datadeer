What data of mine does DataDeer.net collect? What does it do with it?

<h2>Stuff we log:</h2>
We have a log of access stored as:
<ul>
	<li>IP of requester</li>
	<li>Time of request</li>
	<li>HTTP response code</li>
	<li>Received HTTP GET header</li>
</ul>
We have an error log with timestamps.<br>
I guess you could count the hit counter as a log.<br>

<h2>Some stuff we store:</h2>
For signing in, we store your username and a hash of your password.<br>
