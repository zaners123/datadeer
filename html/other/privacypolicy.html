<h1>DataDeer.net Privacy Policy</h1>
Welcome to DataDeer.net's Privacy Policy! Note that nothing in this document is legal advice or worded like how law-stuff should be, but it is my best honest description.
<br><br>
DataDeer.net may refer to itself as "this site", "we","this site", or other similar variants on this page.

<h2>What data does DataDeer.net have on its users?</h2>
<div>
	As of March 31, 2020, the only data DataDeer.net stores is directly given data, and logs of such events.
</div>
<div>
	Some examples of directly given data include:
	<ul>
		<li>If you send a message, the message is stored, along with the time sent.</li>
		<li>If you view a message someone sent to you, it's marked as read.</li>
		<li>If you change a setting, the setting is saved.</li>
		<li>If you upload a file, the file is stored.</li>
	</ul>
	Some examples of logs of such events include:
	<ul>
		<li>If you view a page on DataDeer.net, your IP, the time, the URL viewed, and the browser used are stored. This is necessary so we can prevent someone from spamming the site.</li>
		<li>If something breaks, errors may be generated.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Is my data going to be deleted?</h2>
<div>
	I try my best to keep as much available as possible, but if something illegal (or something that seems like it's illegal) is posted to the site, your account may be disabled and the data may be deleted.
	Odds are though, as long as you use common sense, I probably won't delete it.
</div>
<div>
	As of March 31, 2020, this has only happened twice that I can recall right now, both involved spamming chat, where the spam messages were deleted.

<h2>What about third parties? Does DataDeer.net give data to third parties?</h2>
<div>
	As of March 31, 2020, DataDeer.net has no third parties, and also only uses open source software ran locally.
