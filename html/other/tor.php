DataDeer has an .onion address, and doesn't blacklist tor users<br><br>

<a href="http://datadeerzxn36mti.onion">datadeerzxn36mti.onion</a><br><br>

This is because at DataDeer.net, we feel people should be able to have the right to privacy, without corporations and governments trying to monitor your every move.<br>

What is the story of the .onion address you ask? Well obviously its because:<br>
<ol>
	<li>DataDeer as in DataDeer.net</li>
	<li>ZXN as in Zealously eXtremely Neat</li>
	<li>36 as in the number of pet dogs I wish to have (at least)</li>
	<li>MTI as in Minimum Tiger Interaction (because they're dangerous)</li>
</ol>
