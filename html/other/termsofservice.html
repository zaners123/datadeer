About these Terms

We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We at Data Deer will post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We at Data Deer will post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than seven days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons as designated by Washington State and/or the United States will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service immediately by contacting Data Deer administration at admin@datadeer.net. If there is a conflict between these terms and any additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict. These terms control the relationship between Data Deer and you.
