	<h1>Take an IQ test!</h1>

	Well first, what is IQ? IQ is short for Intelligence Quotient
	and is a bell-curve of how smart you are compared to others, where the average is 100.
	Because of how wide and broad a concept intelligence is, it is hard to test, but I have an accurate test to see your IQ!

	Before you start, I should tell you: IQ is calculated by not just knowing things but also by attention, memory and speed!
	So make sure you:
	<ul>
		<li>Clearly read every question</li>
		<li>Don't be too slow</li>
		<li>Remember previous questions</li>
		<li>Try your best</li>
	</ul>
