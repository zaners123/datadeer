	It is a device you can get to control your house's water sprinklers from your phone.<br>
	It has many benefits such as:
	<ul>
		<li>Can accurately control scheduling, such as watering daily for flower beds, and bi-weekly for grass.</li>
		<li>Cheap at around $50, which is about the price of any other sprinkler control box.</li>
		<li>Can turn of sprinklers on rainy days no matter how far you are away.</li>
		<li>Able to handle more than 16 stations!</li>
		<li>Can make sprinkler maintenance easier because you don't need to keep walking over to the control box.</li>
		<li>Can turn off on certain days of the week, such as not running on Mondays and Wednesdays</li>
	</ul>

	This can take the place of your current sprinkler controller, work with it, or be the only one you have/need.<br>
	The entire thing assembled is around the size of a cereal bowl.
