<h1>The 2000 Genders</h1>
<p>
	A lot of people would agree there are only 2 genders, so why do some people think there are more?
</p>
<h2>But first: The Terminology</h2>
The terminology may not seem important at first, but it is vital for understanding this topic.
<h3>Assigned Sex</h3>
<p>
	When people are born, they are one of two things. <span class="tip">Male or female*<span class="tiptext">Some people <i>are</i> born something else, but this is a different topic</span></span>.
	They either have a p***s or a v****a.
</p>
<p>
	This is commonly referred to as someone's "<span class="tip">Assigned Sex<span class="tiptext">Remember, sex = thing they're born with</span></span>". The sex someone is born with.
</p>
<h3>Gender Identity</h3>
<p>Your "Gender Identity" is the gender that you <span class="tip">personally choose<span class="tiptext">Remember, gender identity = thing people choose</span></span> to identify as.</p>
<h3>Transgender</h3>
<p>
	Nearly always, someone's "Gender Identity" is the same as their "Assigned Sex". But, whenever this isn't the case, they could be referred to as "transgender".
</p>
<h2>The Facts</h2>
<p>
	Whenever someone is transgender, it's up to them. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's wrong.
