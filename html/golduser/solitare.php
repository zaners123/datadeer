<h1>Underwater</h1>
<p>
	I'm pretty sure I made this Freshman year. It's Solitaire, with difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)!
	<br>
	If you want to play it <a href="d.php?q=Solitare.jar">Download it</a> then read these instructions.
	<br>
	I left it the way it was originally.
</p>
Here are the directions to it:
<ul>
	<li>Install Java (it is likely already installed, you need at least Java 1.9)</li>
	<li>Run Solitare.jar (try double-clicking it, if that doesn't work run "java -jar Solitare.jar" on it or look up how to open JAR files)</li>
	<li>Play the game (Use the mouse, drag cards, get the best score!)</li>
</ul>
