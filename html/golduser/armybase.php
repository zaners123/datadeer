	<h1>Army Base</h1>
<p>
	In 7th or 8th grade, I made a game where you defend your base from invaders (it's made in paint).
	<br>
	If you want to play it use this <a href="d.php?q=armybase.zip">Download</a>.
	<br>
	I left it the way it was originally so don't expect it to be great; it was made by a 7th or 8th grader.
</p>
Here are the directions to it:
<ul>
	<li>Install Java (it is likely already installed)</li>
	<li>Extract the ZIP file (right click it and click extract here)</li>
	<li>Open the "game" folder</li>
	<li>Run armybase.jar (try double-clicking it, if that doesn't work run "java -jar armybase.jar" on it or look up how to open JAR files)</li>
	<li>Select a difficulty</li>
	<li>Put your mouse near the side of the screen to pan to the enemy's base.</li>
	<li>Buy troops, upgrade your castle, give your castle lasers.</li>
	<li>Once the enemy base's health is negative, you won! (Like I said, I'm leaving it the way it was...)</li>
</ul>
