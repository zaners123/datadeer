<h1>Underwater</h1>
<p>
	In 7th or 8th grade, I made a game where you move a fish around eating things to become more powerful.
	<br>
	If you want to play it <a href="d.php?q=underwater.zip">Download it</a> then read these instructions.
	<br>
	I left it the way it was originally so don't expect it to be great; it was made by a 7th or 8th grader.
</p>
Here are the directions to it:
<ul>
	<li>Install Java (it is likely already installed)</li>
	<li>Extract the ZIP file (right click it and click extract here)</li>
	<li>Open the "test" folder</li>
	<li>Run underwater.jar (try double-clicking it, if that doesn't work run "java -jar underwater.jar" on it or look up how to open JAR files)</li>
	<li>Play the game (WASD for controls, dollar sign in top right is for the shop)</li>
</ul>
