# DataDeer Search
This is probably one of the only search engines where the entire interface is around 130 lines.

# Webpage Search

It works using an external "spider" script to grab keywords, and when you search those keywords, it gives you those URLs and the text at the start of the page. I made the spider myself in Java, and could put it here if anyone asked.

# Image Search

This is just directly from Flickr, using their API. It's the Safe version, cause the NSFW version requires an account key that I literally just didn't bother to use.
