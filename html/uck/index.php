<h1>Universal College Knowledge</h1>

<h3 style="font-weight: normal;">
	Have you ever taken classes just because they're a prerequisite?<br>
	Have you ever had to take an intro class on something that is your greatest hobby?<br>
	Have you ever known things for years only to still have to take classes on it?<br>
</h3>

<h2>
	If any of these apply to you, put it in your Universal College Knowledge!<br>
	You state things about your knowledge such as:<ul>
		<li>What classes you have taken</li>
		<li>Where you took them</li>
		<li style="list-style: none">&emsp;Or</li>
		<li>What you learned in your hobbies</li>

	</ul>
	This data is then aggregated with other students in the same positions and their end result (whether the credits carried over). Colleges then can see that you know enough to go past intro classes or classes you've already learned.
