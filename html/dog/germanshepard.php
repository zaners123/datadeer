<p>In 1899, the German Shepard originated in, as you would guess, Germany. They were bred to be a working dog
	for herding sheep, and today are very popular and frequently used for helping and protecting police.</p>

<p>The first German Shepard dog was when Von Stephanitz saw a dog at a dog show that he viewed as the perfect working dog. He then purchased it and declared it to be the first German Shepard Dog.</p>
