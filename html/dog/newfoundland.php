<p>The Newfoundland is a giant type of dog brought from Portuguese fishermen to Newfoundland, Canada beginning in the 16th century.</p>

<p>Once colonization in Newfoundland started in 1610, Newfoundlands started becoming more distinct from other dog breeds in ways such as their intelligence and physical size.</p>

<p>Newfoundlands were then divided into the larger "Greater Newfoundland"s and the smaller "Lesser Newfoundland"s. The Smaller Newfoundlands lead to the breeding into modern-day retrievers.</p>
