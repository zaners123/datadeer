	<p>The Molosser is a category of dogs theorized by Jean Pierre MÃ©gnin, along with Lupoides, Braccoides,
		and Graioides. They are commonly larger and stronger than the average dog.</p>

	<p>They were named after King Molossus, who was the grandchild of the heroic Achilles.
		This is because people in their tribe (named Molossians) sailed with these dogs.
		They were used in military and for protection.</p>

	<p>There are many well known Molossers, such as the mastiff, bulldog, boxer, bulldog, <a href="newfoundland.php">newfoundland</a>, and pug.</p>
