# TODO

This is probably more for me to keep track of things, but if anyone else wants to do stuff (as shown in readme), feel free...

- Put all games in V2 format
- Make all PHP require, require_once, and include relative to $_SERVER\[\'DOCUMENT_ROOT\'\]."php/file.php";
- Connect 4 in /game/v2
- More board games, maybe like Go or something
- Organize /other, ideally it shouldn't exist.
